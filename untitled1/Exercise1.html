<p>Montréal is the largest city in Canada's Québec province. It’s set on an island in the Saint Lawrence River and named
    after Mt. Royal, the triple-peaked hill at its heart. Its boroughs, many of which were once independent cities, include neighbourhoods ranging from cobblestoned, French colonial Vieux-Montréal – with the Gothic Revival Notre-Dame Basilica at its centre – to bohemian Plateau.</p>
